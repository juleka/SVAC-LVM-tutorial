\frame{\frametitle{Wartime Sexual Violence}

\begin{itemize}
\item Includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence
\item Constitutes a severe human rights problem
\item Is difficult to observe and document as a practice
\end{itemize}

A lack of systematic data impedes empirical analysis with regard to extent, spatiotemporal trends, and patterns.

}

\frame{\frametitle{Why Conflict-Related Sexual Violence  Is Hard to Measure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shame, fear of retaliation, stigma and rejection due to socio-cultural taboos
\item Inconsistency in testimony and lack of clear narrative due to trauma-induced memory loss
\item Differing conceptualizations and language  used to refer to sexual violence events
\item Perpetrators' incentives to conceal activity and evade accountability for war crimes
\item Blending of state actors and institutions with regard to the perpetration and reporting of these crimes

\end{itemize}

All of these issues vary over space and time.

}

\frame{\frametitle{Why the Observation of Wartime Sexual Violence May Improve over Time}

\begin{itemize}
\item Increasing international focus
\item Changing norms and perceptions of survivors
\item Recent challenges to societal taboos
\item Growing initiatives to empower survivors to speak out
\item Changes in the wording of sexual violence experiences leading to more explicit descriptions
\item Growth in documentation efforts paired with improved documentation practices
\end{itemize}

While these trends  vary across space, we will likely see higher reporting rates in some places  over time.

\frame{\frametitle{How We Currently Measure Wartime Sexual Violence}

\end{figure}
}

\frame{Let's import the data into R and take a look at it:

\begin{itemize}
\item[{\tt \$:}] {\tt cd \textasciitilde/git/SVAC-LVM-tutorial/import}
\item[{\tt \$:}]  {\tt open -a Rstudio src/import-check-data-main.R}
\end{itemize}

In this tutorial, we will only look at reported SVAC with respect  to state forces (`GOV').

\begin{frame}[label=SUDAN-obs]
\frametitle{SVAC Provides Three Indicators that Report Prevalence of Wartime Sexual Violence}
\begin{figure}\centering

\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\frame{

Let's make some more barplots of reported state behavior for other armed conflict cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item[{\tt \$:}] {\tt cd ../visualize}
\item[{\tt \$:}] {\tt open -a Rstudio  src/barplot-sources-by-conflict.R}
\end{itemize}

}

\frame{\frametitle{For Every Conflict-Year, We Have Three Sources Reporting on SVAC Prevalence}
\begin{itemize}
\item For many years, the three prevalence measures diverge (e.g., Sudan 2006, DRC 1998)
\item In other years, the three sources seem to agree (e.g., Sudan 2001-2, DRC 2011)
\item In a considerable number of  years (when looking at the entire dataset), the three sources do not report any SV (e.g., Sudan 1990-1) 
\end{itemize}

How do we deal with converging/diverging information across the three sources? Shall we average across them, or should we choose the most common/lowest/highest level?

}

\frame{\frametitle{What If, for a Given Conflict-Year, We Understand}


\begin{itemize}
\item True SVAC prevalence as a \emph{latent trait} that can't be observed directly but estimated using observed outcomes
\item Available human rights reports  as imperfect measures of the latent level  due to observational challenges
\item Human-coded SVAC variables as imperfect measures of human rights reports due to perceptual coding error
\item Information convergence/divergence across sources as a measure of certainty regarding SVAC prevalence
\end{itemize}

The logic of latent variable models (LVM) follows precisely this conceptual approach to measurement. 
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Added Value of Latent Variable Models}

\begin{itemize}
\item Leverage information from multiple sources
\item Provide probabilistic estimates of a latent trait, i.e., SVAC in our case 
\item Express  our  uncertainty  regarding the estimates of the latent trait through credible intervals 
\item Compute the estimated latent trait at the interval-level (instead of ordinal), which simplifies subsequent analysis 
\item Enable direct probabilistic comparisons across conflict-years and cases
\end{itemize}
