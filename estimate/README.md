# Computing the latent variable models

In this task, we estimate the static and dynamic latent variable models of reported prevalence of armed-conflict sexual violence to obtain a variety of parameters. We will make plots of the cutpoints for the categorical values and check model convergence by plotting the r-hat statistic. When the r-hats are below 1.1 we conclude that a model has converged successfully. We will plot the actual static and dynamic estimates of the latent trait of reported wartime sexual violence in visualize/.
