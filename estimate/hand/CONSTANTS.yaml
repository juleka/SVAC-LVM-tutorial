#CONSTANTS.yaml

random_seed: 146

## A positive integer specifying the number of iterations for each chain (including warmup). The default is 2000.
## iterations are the number of draws from the posterior distribution
static_STAN_iter: 2000

## A positive integer specifying the number of Markov chains (MCMC) we use to estimate the model. The default is 4.
static_STAN_chains: 4

## Number of cores to use when executing the chains in parallel. The default is 1.
## The recommendation is to set the cores option to as many processors as the hardware and RAM allow (up to the number of chains).
## check the specifications of your computer to set the number of cores
static_STAN_cores: 2

dynamic_STAN_iter: 2000

dynamic_STAN_chains: 4

##set the number of cores based on the specifications of your machine
dynamic_STAN_cores: 2

#end.
